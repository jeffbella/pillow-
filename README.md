# Project Pillow-

Project Pillow- contains my application development in python.  Project Pillow- is how I train my fundamentals of Python programming.  Each layer of the project has a folder named for the application and a README describing the contents of the application.  Some applications are inspired by other projects and will be referenced in the README.  

# Motivation
My motivation for training my coding skills is to "make the world a better place" (Thank you silicon valley).  There are large problems in the world that will need to be solved.  I am motivated to help assist and enable those working on these projects. 

# Build Status
The build status is displayed on Github you will see the cadence of the project over time.  Edits, test etc when added.

# Code Style


# Tech/framework used
Below is a list of expected tools and libraries used in the different applications.  For ease of use I will not include anything that comes with the standard python-c 2.7/3.7 installs

# Features
Below will contain a list of Features that have been added to core applications post development


# Application List and Description

### Sals Shipping App

This application takes in 


# Tests
Currently all test will use the Pytest framework to test (unit testing).  As I grow more mature with my application development this may change to a framework that leverages an orchestrator like Jenkins
