# Project Pillow-

Project Pillow- contains personalized application development in python.  It is to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals of Python programming.  The structure of the project is laid out by each folder being its own application.  Some applications are original works some are not.  Each application will contain it's own README that will reference which resource I built the application from, when it was built.  Most applications are not an exact copy and will have my own interpretation this is to showcase that I understand what it is that I am building.

# Motivation
My main motivation for seeking better coding is to "make the world a better place" (Thank you silicon valley).  There are large problems in the world that will need to be solved, and although I may not directly solve them (cancer, diseases, aging) I can enable those working on these projects through the use of ML/AI/Emergent behaviors in complex systems etc.  I take the approach of building in automation to move talented people to work on critical pieces of a problem instead of being bogged down with TOIL.

# Build Status
The build status is displayed on Github you will see the cadence of the project over time.  Edits, test etc when added.

# Code Style


# Tech/framework used
Below is a list of expected tools and libraries used in the different applications.  For ease of use I will not include anything that comes with the standard python-c 2.7/3.7 installs

# Features
Below will contain a list of Features that have been added to core applications post development


# Application List and Description

### Sals Shipping App


# Tests
Currently all test will use the Pytest framework to test (unit testing).  As I grow more mature with my application development this may change to a framework that leverages an orchestrator like Jenkins
